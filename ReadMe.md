### How to switch back to using Android Companion App if using Apple TV ? 

* No way in the AppleTv App and Android Companion App
* But Figured that can do by pairing up and then trying to pair a 3rd device (Cadence Sensor in my case) and then get prompted to switch to using Companion App

* Update 6/11/2018 - did 2 blocks where was at 150w for 20 mins, change to 125 and then back and worked OK so assume Sleep was fix.

### 4/11/2018 - Watts dont increase in Erg Mode

* ie going from 150 to 210 when in 150 for about 10mins
* Using Apple TV Bluetooth (Cos coulnt get Companion app to be visible)
* Doing Spindown test in Zwift App was timing out , so moved the Apple TV nearer the Kickr
